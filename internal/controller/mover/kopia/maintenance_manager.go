package kopia

// NOTE: EnhancedMaintenanceManager has been removed as part of simplifying
// the KopiaMaintenance CRD. The CRD is now namespace-scoped and no longer
// supports repository selectors or priority-based matching.
//
// Maintenance is now handled directly by:
// - KopiaMaintenanceReconciler for KopiaMaintenance CRDs
// - MaintenanceManager for legacy embedded maintenance configuration in ReplicationSources
